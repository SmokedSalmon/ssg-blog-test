## Game play
### Towers
There are 4 categories of towers, with each of their unique characteristics, strength and weakness  
Each category has its Melee Tower and Ranged Tower  

**Melee Tower** can spawn units to *block* enemy along the path, these units have limited health meaning they can be killed by the enemy. You must arrange a matching number & level of them towards your goal.
